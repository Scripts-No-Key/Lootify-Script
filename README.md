# Roblox Lootify Script

## Overview

Welcome to the **Roblox Lootify Script** repository! This script is designed to enhance the gaming experience by enabling loot drops and rewards in Roblox games. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate loot mechanics into your game or an enthusiast wanting to create more dynamic and interactive gameplay, this script is for you. 

Lootify allows game creators to set up random loot drops that can include items like coins, special weapons, or rare collectibles, making gameplay more engaging and rewarding for players. This script is fully customizable, providing flexibility to adjust loot probabilities, items, and drop conditions based on your game's needs.

## Features

- **Random Loot Drops:** Automatically generates loot drops based on predefined conditions like time, player actions, or in-game events.
- **Customizable Loot Pool:** Add and configure any type of loot, including items, currency, or power-ups.
- **Configurable Drop Rates:** Set the drop chances for each item in your loot pool to create balanced rewards.
- **Event-based Drops:** Trigger loot drops based on in-game actions like defeating enemies, completing quests, or achieving milestones.
- **User-friendly Integration:** Easy-to-use and simple to implement in any Roblox game, whether you're using it in a large-scale multiplayer game or a smaller project.
- **Efficient and Lightweight:** Optimized for performance, ensuring smooth gameplay even with multiple loot drops.

## Installation

To install and use the Roblox Lootify Script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the script directly from the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Roblox-Lootify-Script.git
   ```
2. In Roblox Studio, open your game project.
3. Insert the **LootifyScript** module into your game.
4. Customize the loot pool by editing the script's configuration file. Define the items and set drop rates as per your game's requirements.
5. Trigger loot drops by calling the appropriate functions in the script.

```lua
-- Example of triggering loot drop
local Lootify = require(game.ServerScriptService.LootifyScript)
Lootify.DropLoot(player)
```

## Configuration

You can configure the following parameters in the script:

- **Loot Pool:** The items that can be dropped. Each item is assigned a drop rate (chance of being dropped).
- **Drop Rates:** Set the probability for each item to drop. Drop rates are defined as percentages (0-100%).
- **Loot Conditions:** Define the conditions under which loot drops occur, such as time, player actions, or in-game events.
  
Example configuration:

```lua
Lootify.SetLootPool({
    {Item = "Coin", Rate = 50},
    {Item = "Rare Sword", Rate = 10},
    {Item = "Health Potion", Rate = 30},
    {Item = "Mystery Box", Rate = 10}
})

Lootify.SetDropConditions({
    OnKill = true,
    OnLevelUp = false,
})
```

## Usage

After installing the script, you can call the `Lootify.DropLoot(player)` function whenever you want to trigger a loot drop. The script checks the defined conditions and randomly selects an item based on the probabilities you've set.

### Example Usage:

```lua
local Lootify = require(game.ServerScriptService.LootifyScript)

game.Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
    player.CharacterAdded:Connect(function(character)
        Lootify.DropLoot(player)
    end)
end)
```

## Compatibility

The Roblox Lootify Script is compatible with the following:

- **Roblox Studio:** Fully supported for both studio testing and live games.
- **All Roblox Games:** Works for any game mode, including RPGs, FPS, or simulation games.

## Customization

The script is designed to be highly customizable. You can modify it to add more complex features, such as:

- Custom loot animations when items are dropped.
- Dynamic loot pools that change based on game progress.
- Integration with other game systems like quests or combat.
